      솔직히 말하면, 최근 CSS를 따라가는 것은 벅찼어요. 다행히 올해에는 Chen Hui Jing이 설문 설계를 주도했고, 작년에 Lea Verou가 한 작업을 기반으로 발전시켰습니다.

      우리는 운좋게도 Google Chrome 팀의 지원을 받을 수 있었어요. Google Chrome 팀은 이 결과들을 활용해서 (다른 브라우저 제공업체와 함께) 자사의 로드맵을 안내하는 데 도움을 주고 있어요.

      모든 추가 도움 덕분에 우리는 여러 새로운 기능들을 소개할 수 있었어요. **차트를 커스텀**하는 기능부터 시작해서, 이제는 차트 옆에 있는 <span class="customize-chart-icon">“설정”</span> 아이콘을 클릭하여 급여, 국가 또는 다른 원하는 변수로 차트를 필터링할 수 있어요!

      이 모든 것을 정리한 후에, 이제 2023년에는 CSS가 어떻게 발전했는지 살펴봅시다!

      <span class="first-letter">C</span>SS는 전례없는 발전의 시기를 겪고 있어요. :has(), container queries, subgrid 등 많은 새로운 기능들이 거의 매달 브라우저에 등장하고 있습니다.

      이 모든 발전의 결과로 인해 일이 좀 벅찰 수 있어요. 다행히 올해에는 [Chen Hui Jing](https://chenhuijing.com/)이 설문을 설계하고 CSS 정글에 대한 안내를 도와주셨어요.
      
      설문에 관해서 얘기하자면, 브라우저 제공업체들이 [Interop](https://web.dev/interop-2023/) 계획의 일환으로 어떤 기능을 우선적으로 작업할지 결정하는 데 해당 데이터를 사용하여 도움을 받고 있다는 걸 알고 계셨나요?

      마침내, 올해에는 새로운 기능을 소개합니다: 자신만의 데이터 필터로 **차트를 커스텀**할 수 있는 기능입니다. 어떤 새로운 통찰력이 얻으실지 기대가 되네요!

      나쁜 비디오 품질, 불편한 카세트, 되감기 과정을 생각하면 VHS 시대에 그리워할 만한 것은 별로 없습니다. 그러나 우리가 *그리워하는* 한 가지는 빈 VHS 테이프에 새겨져 있던 멋진 90년대 시각 효과들이에요.

      그런데 이제 재능있는 Christopher Kirk-Nielsen 덕분에 CSS에 대한 애정을 기리면서도 이 모든 레트로한 멋을 즐길 수 있습니다!

  # Conclusion
  ###########################################################################

  - key: conclusion.css2023
    t: |
      <span class="first-line">As usage of newer CSS features has been trending upwards, usage of CSS frameworks has been on a downward slope.</span>

      This could be an indication that folks are starting to get used to the idea that you don’t necessarily have to wait to use newer CSS features, because browsers will catch up a lot quicker than before.

      With high awareness of native CSS features like nesting and `:has()` (which can act like a parent selector, but is much more than that!), it seems like we are on the brink of widespread adoption.

      Out of all these features, I did have a personal favourite for this year, and that is `text-wrap: balance`. It provides a one-line fix for a request that I’ve constantly gotten over my entire web development career: “can we adjust that headline so the last word isn’t an orphan?”

      It was also interesting that so many developers felt that animating to auto and masonry layout were missing CSS features. It's true it's always been tricky for browsers to determine element dimensions (especially height) when they're not explicitly declared. 

      But as [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) mentioned last year, with initiatives such as [Interop](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023) bringing browsers together, features thought previously impossible can now potentially become reality!

  # FAQ/About
  ###########################################################################

  - key: about.content
    t: >
      The 2023 State of CSS survey ran from June 15 to July 15 2023, and collected 9,108 responses. The survey is run by [Devographics](https://www.devographics.com/), with help from a team of open-source contributors and consultants. 


      The State of CSS logo and t-shirt were designed and animated by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).


      ### Survey Goals

      This survey, along with the [State of JavaScript](https://stateofjs.com/) survey, was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices. 


      As such, these surveys are focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included. 


      Additionally, survey data is also used by browser vendors to prioritize features and inform initiatives such as [Interop 2023](https://web.dev/interop-2023/).


      ### Survey Design

      This year, survey design was lead by [Chen Hui Jing](https://chenhuijing.com/) thanks to a funding grant from the Google Chrome team. All survey questions were optional. 

      ### Survey Audience

      The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way. Respondents were primarily a mix of respondents from past surveys (alerted through a dedicated mailing list) and social media traffic. 

      ### Project Funding

      Funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:

      - **T-shirt sales**. 

      - **Sponsored Links**: the links to recommended resources at the bottom of each page are provided by our partner [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).

      - **Sponsored Charts**: starting last year, anybody can now also choose to directly sponsor a chart for $10 or more, and get their Twitter avatar displayed next to it.

      - **Google**: this year, the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) team set aside a budget to hire Lea to help design the survey, as well as funded me directly to help support my work. 

      - **Nijibox**: Japan-based [Nijibox](https://nijibox.jp/) has also graciously accepted to sponsor my efforts to help make these yearly surveys more sustainable. 


      ### Technical Overview

      You can find a more in-depth technical overview of how the surveys are run [here](https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-the-devographics-surveys-are-run-2023-edition-1p6a). Our code is [open-source](https://github.com/Devographics/Monorepo/).
