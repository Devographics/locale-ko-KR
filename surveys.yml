      ### 1. Data Collection

      In addition to the data collected through a survey's questions, we collect your device, browser, OS, browser version, and referrer.

      Note that all questions are entirely optional, and we never link any identifiable information (such as email addresses) to your survey answers.

      ### 2. Email Collection

      We may optionally collect your email to:


      1. Generate a magic log-in link, after which we discard your email and only keep a one-way hash in our user database.

      2. Contact you once survey results are available, as well as when we launch future editions of a survey and for infrequent announcements. You can unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time, and your email is discarded from our records once it is sent to our email newsletter provider.

      3. Send you a recap list of features or tools you want to learn more about. We will discard your address once the email has been sent out through our transactional email provider.


      When we do collect your email address, it is never linked to your responses for a survey, or to your user account.

      ### 3. Cookies

      We set a log-in cookie, and our hosting provider (Vercel) may also sets its own cookie. We do not set any other cookie or use client-side analytics or ads.

      ### 4. Data Use

      We process the data and then use it to publish reports. We also make the entire dataset publicly available.

      ### 5. Data/Account Deletion

      You can email us at [hello@stateofjs.com](mailto:hello@stateofjs.com) if you'd like us to delete all or part of your data.

  - key: general.js2020.survey_intro
    t: |
      2020 has been a tough year for everyone, one that makes worrying about the
      latest JavaScript frameworks seem pretty futile in comparison.

      Still, the world has to move on, and so does JavaScript. And once again, with your help
      we'll try to build a comprehensive picture of the ecosystem to find out a little bit more
      about where it's going.

  - key: general.css2021.survey_intro
    t: |
      Hey CSS, what have you been up to lately? Oh really, `@container`? Oh and
      intrinsic sizing? And `@property` too?! Wow, you've been busy!

      Even though the pandemic kept on making everybody's lives harder throughout 2021, somehow
      dedicated contributors around the world managed to keep CSS moving forward.
      And so once more it's time to survey the CSS ecosystem and figure out
      where this is all going. And maybe learn about a few new things while you're at it!

  - key: general.js2021.survey_intro
    t: |
      First the 2020 Olympics got pushed back to 2021,
      and now the 2021 State of JavaScript survey is happening now, in 2022!

      It's true: between work, family, and and all the turmoil in the world,
      some things got disrupted a little.

      But while the year may be off-by-one, we hope the data provided by the
      survey itself will be just as informative and insightful as ever.
      And don't worry, there will be another survey towards the end of this year to set things straight again!

  - key: general.graphql2022.survey_intro
    t: |
      When GraphQL was first introduced it offered a radically new way to build APIs, with more control, more granularity, and more flexibility.

      But that flexibility came at a price in the form of extra complexity, and a crop of frameworks, libraries, and services quickly appeared to help define better patterns and workflows.

      Now, for the first time ever we're surveying the GraphQL community to figure out which of these many tools are the most popular, and which features are actually being used. With your help, let's see what GraphQL has been up to in 2022!

  - key: general.css2022.survey_intro
    t: |
      CSS keeps progressing at an unprecedented rate. Luckily this year we got help from someone at the forefront of all these changes: [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) took the lead on selecting this year's questions, with a special focus on highlighting new and upcoming CSS features.

      What's more, the survey results will also help browser vendors prioritize their roadmaps and work towards better compatibility between browsers.

      With all this out of the way, let's see how CSS evolved in 2022!

  - key: general.js2022.survey_intro
    t: |
      For the first time in a while, it feels like the status quo of the JavaScript ecosystem is being questioned.

      Faster bundling with Vite, island architecture with Astro, resumability with Qwik… New entrants are challenging the old guard, and the result is a lot more excitement, but also
      a lot more uncertainty.

      So once more, let's try and figure out together where JavaScript is going, in 2022 and beyond.

  - key: general.css2023.survey_intro
    t: |
      To help you keep up with `:has()`, `@container`, and all the other new CSS features, we're introducing a new feature of our own this year: the **Reading List**.

      As you take the survey, you'll be able to bookmark any feature you want and learn more about it after you submit your answers.

      This year [Chen Hui Jing](https://chenhuijing.com/) took the lead of the survey design process, building on the work done by [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) last year. And as usual, your feedback here will play a key role in helping browser vendors prioritize their roadmaps and work towards better compatibility between browsers.

      With all this out of the way, let's see how CSS has evolved so far in 2023!

  # Intro for actual survey page
  - key: general.html2023.survey_intro
    t: |
      While web developers tend to focus on JavaScript and CSS, none of what we do would be possible without HTML acting as the foundation.

      It has long seemed like HTML wasn't evolving, but things may be changing.
      New elements like `<selectlist>` are on the horizon, cool new features like popovers,
      and a swath of related browser APIs (Web Components, PWAs, etc.).

      This year, [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) took on the formidable task of leading the design of this brand new survey, from content to UX and beyond.

      Building on the success of [State of JS](http://stateofjs.com/) and [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com/), we introduce **State of HTML**;
      the last missing piece that completes the trilogy, so we can track the evolution of the web platform as a whole.

      Benefits to you:
      - Survey results are **used by browsers** and standards groups **for roadmap prioritization**.
      Your responses can help get features you care about implemented, browser incompatibilities being prioritized, and gaps in the platform being addressed.
      - Learn about new and upcoming features; add features to your reading list and get a list of resources at the end!
      - Get a personalized knowledge score and see how you compare to other respondents

      The survey will be open for 3 weeks, but responses entered **within the first 9 days (until October 1st)** will have a much higher impact on the Web,
      as preliminary data will be used for certain prioritization efforts that have deadlines before then.

  - key: general.react2023.survey_intro
    t: |
      React가 처음 등장할 당시, 웹 개발 분야에 큰 변화가 올 것이 확실했습니다.

      어쨌든 React는 Facebook을 개발할 때 사용되었고, "JSX"라는 조금 이상한 개념의 도입에도 불구하고 개발자들은 빠르게 React를 도입했습니다. 무엇보다 인상깊은 것은 함수 컴포넌트와 Hooks 같은 주요 변화가 일어났음에도 커뮤니티가 이를 버티고 따라갔다는 것입니다.

      하지만 이제 10년이 흘렀고, 최근에 소개된 React 서버 컴포넌트는 아마 React의 등장 이후 생기는 가장 큰 변화가 될 것으로 보입니다.

      이번에도 커뮤니티는 이 변화를 따라갈 수 있을까요? 아니면 개발자들이 Svelte, Solid나 다른 기술로 넘어가게 될까요?

      사상 최초의 State of React 설문조사를 통해 함께 알아봅시다!

  # JS 2023 
  - key: general.js2023.survey_intro
    t: >
      JavaScript는 브라우저 언어로 시작해서 Node.js와 함께 서버 언어로 까지 나아가고 있습니다.

      그리고 2023년에는 이 전체 생태계가 브라우저와 서버간의 차이를 줄이려는 시도를 할 준비가 된 것 같습니다. 
      React Server Components와 같은 기능, Solid와 Qwik와 같은 프레임워크, 그리고 Next.js와 Sveltekit 같은 메타 프레임워크를 통해, 클라이언트들에게 코드와 데이터를 더 좋은 방식으로 제공하는 것이 JavaScript의 새로운 큰 목표가 되었습니다.
      
      아니면 TypeScript라고 해야 할까요? 이제는 두 언어를 구분하기 어려워졌으니, 구분하지 않는 것이 좋을 것 같습니다.

      대신, 설문조사에 참여해서 무엇이 새롭고, 무엇이 오래되었으며, 그리고 앞으로 몇 년간 어떤 async/awaits가 우리를 기다리고 있는지 알려주시기 바랍니다!
